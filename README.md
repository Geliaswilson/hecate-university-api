# Hecate University
## A model for the intersection between flexible navigation, broad accessibility, and exciting, tantalizing fantasy fiction.
Powered by React and Node, Hecate University seeks to enable the fantasy fiction reader an attention-grabbing and exploratorily exciting experience.
It focuses on accessibility concerns with its considerations of font and spacing to retain a reader's eyes even through large sections of text.
There is also a complex, bt visually comprehensive network of navigation both within individual pages as well as across pages, so that a reader may find lore related to the story they enjoy as quickly as their curiosity strikes!
